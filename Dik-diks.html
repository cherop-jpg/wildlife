    <p>The dik-dik is a type of dwarf antelope that lives in arid regions of East Africa. They can live in such barren environments because<br> they get water from the vegetation they eat. They also take cover in undergrowth to protect themselves from predators, including eagles and cats.<br>

        There are four species of dik-diks, but just two of them live in Kenya. These include Guenther's dik-dik and Kirk's dik-dik.<br> Kirk's is the largest dik-dik, though it's still small in comparison to other antelopes.<br> It stands at just 45 centimetres (18 inches) tall and weighs only 7.2 kilograms (15.8 pounds).<br> Guenther's dik-dik is smaller but has a longer snout.
        
        The IUCN lists both Kirk's dik-dik and Guenther's dik-dik as least concern,<br>though they are threatened by expanding agricultural settlements and excessive hunting in some areas.</p>
