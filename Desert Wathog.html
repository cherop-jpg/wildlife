    <title>WARTHOG</title>
</head>
<body>
    The desert warthog is a member of the pig family. It has a large, warty head, a coarse mane, and two pairs of tusks.<br> Unlike the common warthog, which can be found across most of Africa, the desert warthog only lives in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia.<br> It lives in savannah and shrubland habitats, where it feeds on grass and other vegetation and uses abandoned aardvark burrows as a place to shelter.<br>

The desert warthog is listed by the IUCN as least concern. <br>However, the population faces several risks in Kenya, including growing human and livestock numbers.<br> This increases competition for both water and food.</p>
