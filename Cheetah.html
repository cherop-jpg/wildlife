    <P><i>The Cheetah</i><br>
        One of the most recognizable animals in Kenya is the cheetah. These spotty cats each with their own unique patterns-are skilled hunters,<br> in part because of their natural speed and agility. In fact,cheetahs are the fastest mammals on earth.<br> They can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in just three seconds.<br> Another interesting cheetah fact?Unlike lions, tigers,jaguars, and leopards, cheetahs can't roar-they can only purr.<br>
        These cats live and hunt in open grasslands across Africa.They can be found in countries including Kenya, Algeria, South Africa, and Niger.<br>
        The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classes cheetahs as vulnerable.<br> This means the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild. There are just 6,517 mature cheetahs left in the wild, and their population is decreasing.<br> Cheetahs are at particular risk from habitat loss because they need such a large range. <br>Most cheetahs live in unprotected areas, where they come into conflict with farmers.</P>
